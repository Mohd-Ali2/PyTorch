# PyTorch Project Example

A basic PyTorch project example that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple neural network using PyTorch.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple example of a neural network built from scratch using PyTorch. The project showcases:
- Basic tensor operations and data manipulation.
- Using `autograd` for automatic differentiation.
- Constructing a feedforward neural network with fully-connected layers.
- Training the model using a dummy dataset.
- Saving and loading the trained model.


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **PyTorch (>=1.7)**
- **NumPy**

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy
